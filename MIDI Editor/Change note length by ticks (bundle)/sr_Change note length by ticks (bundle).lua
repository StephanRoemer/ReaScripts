--    # Description
--    * These scripts will change the note length by ticks.
--    * In the arrange view (item view), selected events are not taken into account, because you can't see what is selected.
--    * In the inline editor, you MUST hover the mouse over the active inline editor, otherwise ALL events will 
--    be affected, instead of only the selected ones.
--    * When hovering an inline editor, only the take under the mouse cursor will be affected, regardles of the item selection.
--    * You can easily customize the values in the scripts.
--    * The scripts work in the MIDI editor, inline editor and arrange view.
