-- @description Nudge notes (bundle)
-- @version 1.42
-- @changelog
--   + fixed a lot of bugs and tidied the code
--   + if you nudge notes from the arrangement, selected notes are not taken into account, because you can't see what is selected from, 
--   the arrangement. When you want to nudge notes from the inline editor, you MUST hover the mouse over the active inline editor, 
--   otherwise ALL notes will be nudged, instead of only the selected ones.

--    # Description
--    * This script bundles consists of 2 scripts that nudges either all notes or selected notes left/right.
--    * If you nudge from the arrangement, selected notes are not taken into account, because you can't see what is selected from
--    the arrangement. If you want to nudge from the inline editor, you MUST hover the mouse over the active inline editor, otherwise 
--    ALL notes will be affected, instead of only the selected ones.
--    * You can easily edit the scripts to adjust them to your needs or create new ones
--    * The scripts work in arrangement, MIDI editor and inline editor
