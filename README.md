# Stephan RÃ¶mer's scripts for Reaper

New to Reaper and a scripting n00b, but loving the scripting API. So, here you will find scripts, I am working on.

These scripts can be added via ReaPack into Reaper. Here's the repository URL:

```

```

```diff
- Please install the "sr_MIDI functions" package, when selecting any MIDI Editor scripts. Most of the functions are stored in this file and some scripts won't work without it!
```
